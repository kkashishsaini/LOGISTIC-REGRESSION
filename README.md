# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS PURELY A CLASSIFICATION SUPERVISED LEARNING PROBLEM. IN SUCH TYPE OF PROBLEM LABELLED DATA SET IS GIVEN.
LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS USED TO SEPARATE TWO OR MORE CLASSES USING LINES, AND HYPERPLANES RESPECTIVELY.  

LoR MAKES LINES AND CHECKS WHERE THE POINT IS TO BE PREDICTED LIES. THIS TECHNIQUE IS ALSO KNOWN AS ONE VS REST. 
IN THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM, THE CLASS LABEL IS ALWAYS FIXED. 
SIKIT, SK LEARN LIBRARIES ARE USED.
 
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. 
It can take two or more fixed values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. 
Multinomial logistic regression can model scenarios where there are more than two possible discrete outcomes. 
Logistic regression is a useful analysis method for classification problems, where you are trying to determine if a new sample fits best into a category.
